# 1Ren2Hack
 Easy multitool to hacking Ren'Py games.

ATTENTION, DUDE: I, the creator of this multitool, better known as tetyastan, do NOT take responsibility for the following listed scenarios that may have happened to a user of this project:

1. The operating system/visual novel files were destroyed while using the script, resulting in irreversible consequences related to them.
2. The user made an error while using the script, resulting in irreversible consequences related to the operating system/visual novel.
3. The user was unaware that the actions of the script cannot be undone.
4. Geez, just remember that EVERYTHING you do with the script is FULLY your responsibility! From the moment you download this script and start interacting with it, ALL consequences are YOUR responsibility.

**Thank you for using 1Ren2Hack!**
