# 1Ren2Hack
 Easy multitool to hacking Ren'Py games.

ATTENTION, DUDE: I, the creator of this multitool, better known as tetyastan, do NOT take responsibility for the following listed scenarios that may have happened to a user of this project:

1. The operating system/visual novel files were destroyed while using the script, resulting in irreversible consequences related to them.
2. The user made an error while using the script, resulting in irreversible consequences related to the operating system/visual novel.
3. The user was unaware that the actions of the script cannot be undone.
4. Geez, just remember that EVERYTHING you do with the script is FULLY your responsibility! From the moment you download this script and start interacting with it, ALL consequences are YOUR responsibility.

I would also like to clarify my personal attitude towards this project.
I in no way respect the use of this script in relation to Ren'Py novels, especially, as an example, in relation to the "Doki Doki Literature Club!" modification called "Monika After Story".
If you're the kind of asshole who just wants to give yourself a shitload of affection points, I wish you'd think twice before you act. Wouldn't it be better to take a little initiative, huh?
If you're the poor guy who lost his MAS save files (which is my friend for whom I created this project), you've come to the right place. This script will help you.

Thank you for using 1Ren2Hack!
