# 1Ren2Hack
 Easy multitool to hacking Ren'Py games.

ATTENTION, DUDE: I, the creator of this multitool, better known as tetyastan, do NOT take responsibility for the following listed scenarios that may have happened to a user of this project:

1. The operating system/visual novel files were destroyed while using the script, resulting in irreversible consequences related to them.
2. The user made an error while using the script, resulting in irreversible consequences related to the operating system/visual novel.
3. The user was unaware that the actions of the script cannot be undone.
4. Geez, just remember that EVERYTHING you do with the script is FULLY your responsibility! From the moment you download this script and start interacting with it, ALL consequences are YOUR responsibility.

I would also like to clarify my personal attitude towards this project.

I in no way respect the use of this script in relation to Ren'Py novels, especially, as an example, in relation to the "Doki Doki Literature Club!" modification called "Monika After Story".

If you're the kind of asshole who just wants to give yourself a shitload of affection points, I wish you'd think twice before you act. Wouldn't it be better to take a little initiative, huh?

BUT if you're the poor guy who lost his MAS save files (which is my friend for whom I created this project), you've come to the right place. This script will help you.

**Thank you for using 1Ren2Hack!**

# Requirements

   ### Python >= 3.10
   ### Tkinter (install on Linux/MacOS)
   #### All other requirements will be set automatically when you run the script for the first time.

# Guide

### 0. Info about novell build (+ Console Hack Patch Module)

   1. Select the path to the root folder of the game (NOT the "game" folder or any other folder).
   2. Get information about the novel! :D
   3. If you want, you can use Console Hack Patch technology to hack the developer console.

   #### WARNING: Even if the script gives you "Unknown value" in the "DEVELOPER MODE:" field, you can safely use the Console Hack Patch technology. It will work.
   #### WARNING 2: If "*1R1H* Unknown value." is entered instead of the fields, the script was unable to output information about the selected novel.


# TODO

### 1. Decompile RPYC and RPA
   With the RPYC and/or RPA decompiling option, the user will be able to decompile specific files/folders or all files/folders, or unzip the above from Ren'Py archives. 

#### 2. DDLC: MAS (Save Editor)
   The MAS save editor will allow the user to change a large number of game parameters.
